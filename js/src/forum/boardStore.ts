 * zone hosts on every redraw — it has to, because Mithril's own redraw wipes
 * the elements it appended — so a widget placed in a zone is re-created from
 * scratch each time anything on the page changes. A component that fetched in
 * `oninit` and called `m.redraw()` when the answer came back therefore fetched,
 * redrew, was rebuilt, fetched again, and did not stop: eighty requests in a
 * few seconds, and a widget that never finished rendering because it was never
 * alive long enough to.
 *
 * So the data, the timer and the in-flight request live here, where a remount
 * cannot touch them, and the component is a reader. It is also why the poll is
 * one timer for the page rather than one per placement: a scoreboard in the
 * sidebar and another above the list are two views of the same fact.
