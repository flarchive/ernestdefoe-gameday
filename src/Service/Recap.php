/**
 * The post a game thread ends with.
 *
 * 🚨 A pure function of the game and its box score, returning post text. No
 * database, no clock, no settings — so what it writes can be read in a test
 * rather than inferred from a post somewhere.
 *
 * 🚨 This is the SIBLING of `Services/Recap.php` in the Convoro build, and the
 * sentences below are deliberately the same words. What differs is only how
 * they are marked up: Convoro posts a structured document and can draw a real
 * table; a Flarum post is text that a formatter parses, and which formatter is
 * installed differs from site to site.
 *
 * 🚨 So the markup is asked for rather than assumed. A recap written in
 * Markdown on a board with no Markdown extension shows literal `**` to every
 * reader — that has happened here before — and one written in BBCode on a board
 * without it shows `[b]`. The emphasis style is decided by the caller from what
 * is actually enabled, and `none` is a first-class answer that reads perfectly
 * well.
 *
 * 🚨 And no table. Convoro's recap draws one because it can; here a table would
 * need a Markdown extension with table support, which most boards do not have,
 * and the failure mode is a screenful of pipes. One statistic per line reads
 * better on a phone anyway, which is where most of these are read.
 *
 * 🚨 The STRUCTURE lives here and the WORDS live in the sport, exactly as on the
 * Convoro side. Every game has a score, a result, a sentence or two on how it
 * went, the players worth naming and a comparison; that a team out-gains another
 * by 350 yards or has 62% of the ball is `Sports\Sport`, and it is why adding a
 * league is a class of sentences rather than a second `Recap`.
