/**
 * Baseball.
 *
 * 🚨 The statistic keys are PREFIXED, and that is not decoration. ESPN answers
 * a baseball team's statistics as GROUPS — batting, pitching, fielding — and
 * `hits` appears in all three meaning three different things: hits made, hits
 * allowed, and hits handled in the field. Flattening them onto bare names would
 * silently pick whichever group came last and print a pitcher's line as the
 * batting figure. The provider prefixes them; this reads them prefixed.
 *
 * 🚨 Baseball is the sport where the box score is the story. A one-run game and
 * a ten-run game are the same sport played differently, and the sentences below
 * are about how runs were manufactured rather than about a margin, because in
 * baseball the margin says the least of any sport here.
