 * 🚨 The sport the seam was proved against, because it disagrees with gridiron
 * about nearly everything a recap says. A draw is an ordinary Saturday rather
 * than a curiosity; three goals is a hammering where three points is nothing;
 * possession is a percentage rather than a clock; and a team that had eighteen
 * shots to six can perfectly well have lost. If the same `Recap` writes a
 * readable post about both of these, it will write one about basketball.
 *
 * Statistic names are ESPN's own, taken from a real Everton 2–2 Manchester
 * United box score rather than guessed.
