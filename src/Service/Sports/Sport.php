/**
 * What a sport says about itself.
 *
 * 🚨 The structure of a recap is the same everywhere and the WORDS are not.
 * Every game has a score, a winner or a draw, a couple of sentences on how it
 * went, the players worth naming and a comparison — that is `Recap`, and it
 * does not change. What changes is that a football team out-gains another by
 * 350 yards to 284 and a football team has 62% of the ball; that twenty-eight
 * points is a rout and three goals is a hammering; that one sport has carries
 * and another has shots on target; and that in one of them a draw is a normal
 * Saturday and in the other it is a curiosity.
 *
 * So a sport supplies vocabulary and thresholds, and nothing else. Adding a
 * league becomes a class of sentences rather than a change to how a recap is
 * built — which is the whole point, because the alternative is four `Recap`
 * classes that drift.
 *
 * 🚨 A sport is NOT a provider. Where the numbers come from is Picks' business;
 * this is only what to call them once they have arrived.
