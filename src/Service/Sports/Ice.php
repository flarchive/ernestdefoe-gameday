 * Ice hockey.

 * 🚨 Statistic names read off a live NHL summary: `shotsTotal`, `powerPlayPct`,
 * `faceoffPercent`, `hits`, `blockedShots`, `giveaways`, `penaltyMinutes`.
 *
 * 🚨 Hockey's own trap is the SHOT COUNT. A team can be out-shot 40 to 20 and
 * win, and it happens often enough that a recap treating shots the way gridiron
 * treats yardage would be wrong most nights. So the shots sentence is written
 * to survive disagreeing with the score, and the goaltender is named when the
 * numbers say he is the reason.
