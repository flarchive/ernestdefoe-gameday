/**
 * Basketball — the NBA and college.
 *
 * 🚨 The statistic names are ESPN's own, read off a live NBA summary rather
 * than guessed: `fieldGoalsMade-fieldGoalsAttempted`, `threePointFieldGoalPct`,
 * `totalRebounds`, `turnovers`, `pointsInPaint`. A key invented here would
 * simply never match, and a comparison that silently prints nothing is the
 * worst kind of wrong.
 *
 * 🚨 Basketball is the sport where the SCORE is least informative. Every game
 * ends near a hundred points and a fifteen-point win is comfortable, so the
 * margins below are nothing like gridiron's — twenty-eight points is a rout in
 * football and a normal Tuesday here is closer to twenty.
